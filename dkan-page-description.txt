Advanced GIS Methods Training: Retail Centres and Catchment Areas

This course explains what retail centres are, and different methods of constructing catchments for them, including fixed-ring buffers, drive time catchments and Huff model catchments. 

It is split into two parts, each with a video clip and a workbook to work through:
- Part 1: Retail Centres
- Part 2: Retail Catchment Areas

*You need some prior knowledge of R to get the most from this course. If you are new to R, we recommend you complete the [Short Course on Using R as a GIS](https://data.cdrc.ac.uk/dataset/short-course-using-r-gis) first.*

- Understand what the CDRC Retail Centres dataset is and what it looks like
- Know how to construct a basic Hierarchy for the Retail Centres
- Know how to delineate fixed-ring buffers for the Retail Centres
- Know how to derive drive-time catchments for Retail Centres using the HERE API
- Understand what a Huff model is, and what its basic components are
